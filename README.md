# 16-bit ALU and Memory Design

🚀 **Welcome to the 16-bit ALU and Memory Design Project!**
This project is a comprehensive implementation of a 16-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) integrated with registers and RAM. It demonstrates the fundamental structure and functionality of a simple processor system, focusing on memory access and data manipulation through arithmetic and logic operations.

## 🌟 Project Highlights

### 🏗️ Components Overview

#### 1. **16-bit Register**
   📌 Acts as a storage unit for intermediate or temporary data.
   - Data from this register is sent to the ALU for computations.

#### 2. **16-bit ALU**
   🔧 Performs arithmetic and logic operations such as addition, subtraction, AND, OR, and NOT.
   - Accepts inputs from the 16-bit register and another source (multiplexer-controlled).
   - Outputs the result of computations to either RAM or another component.

#### 3. **RAM (Data Memory)**
   🗄️ Stores and retrieves data using the address generated by the ALU.
   - Data input (D) is sourced from the ALU output, while data output is sent back to the system through another multiplexer.

#### 4. **Multiplexers (MUX)**
   🔀 Allow selection of data from multiple sources based on control signals.
   - Control the flow of data between the ALU, RAM, and registers.

#### 5. **Immediate Values**
   ✏️ The immediate values (from instruction encoding) are used as direct inputs for operations or memory addressing.
   - Extended to 16 bits to align with the width of the system.

## ⚙️ Key Functionalities

### ✨ Core Features
- **Arithmetic Operations**: The ALU can add or subtract data from the register and other inputs.
- **Logic Operations**: Perform bitwise operations like AND, OR, and NOT.
- **Memory Access**: The ALU generates addresses for RAM to perform read/write operations.
- **Data Routing**: Multiplexers route the correct data to the required components based on control signals.

### 🧠 Example Operation

1. **Input Data**:
   - Data is loaded into the 16-bit register and RAM.
   - Immediate values are prepared (if needed).

2. **ALU Computation**:
   - Register 1 sends its data to the ALU.
   - Register 2 provides data for a secondary ALU input via the multiplexer.
   - The ALU computes the result and outputs it.

3. **Memory Write**:
   - ALU output serves as an address for RAM.
   - Data from Register 2 is written to the specified address in RAM.

4. **Memory Read**:
   - ALU generates an address.
   - RAM sends the data stored at that address to the next stage (e.g., a register).

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Open the design in a digital circuit simulator (e.g., Logisim, Quartus, or similar).
2. Load the initial data into registers and RAM.
3. Set the control signals (e.g., `RegDst`, `ALUOp`, `MemRead`, `MemWrite`) as required.
4. Observe data flow and results through the ALU, RAM, and registers.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- 🔢 Expand the ALU with additional operations (e.g., multiplication, division).
- 📈 Increase the memory size for handling larger datasets.
- 🔀 Add support for branching and conditional jumps.
